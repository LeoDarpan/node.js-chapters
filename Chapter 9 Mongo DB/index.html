                MongoDB
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Mongo DB is a non SQL databasse.</li>
                <li>It doesn't store data in the form of tables.</li>
                <li>It stores records in the form of documents.</li>
                <li>The documents can be of any type: User, blog, author et cetera.</li>
                <li>One DB can store only one type of documents.</li>
                <li>Every document represents a single record.</li>
                <li>The documents store data in the form of JS objects or JSON.</li>
                <li>All the data is in the form of key value pair.</li>
                <li>It also generates an ID for each document automatically.</li>
                <li>
                    How to use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It can be installed locally or</li>
                        <li>It offers a cloud service as well which is very easy to maintain.</li>
                        <li>MongoDB Atlas is the service that let's developers make online collections of documents to work on websites.</li>
                        <li>MongoDB stores databases in the form of a cluster.</li>
                        <li>In the cluster a database can be created which is a collection of documents.</li>
                        <li>
                            Important steps to perform while making a DB in Mongo:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Go to the cluster.</li>
                                <li>Click on Browse collections</li>
                                <li>Then create a collection.</li>
                                <li>Click on Add my own data button and give name to the database and the collection.</li>
                                <li>Next, we need to create a user that can access the DB from the app code.</li>
                                <li>For that go to Database access and add a user with a password.</li>
                                <li>This makes sure that not just anyone is messing with the database.</li>
                                <li>Only the users which have access to the DB can do the crud on the same.</li>
                            </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>To connect the DB to the app, we can go to Connect in the databases section and select the option to connect it to our app with the link.</li>
                            <li>The link is placed in the app, can be stored in a variable.</li>
                            <li>The connection setup and the handling of requests is taken care by Mongoose.</li>
                            <li>Mongoose wraps MongoDb into models.</li>
                            <li>Mongoose is an Object Document Mapping library.</li>
                            <li>
                                Two models exist basically
                                <ul>
                                    <li>User model</li>
                                    <li>Blog model</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Both these models allow CRUD to be done.</li>
                            <li>Mongo DB or Mongoose both work with Schemas which define the structure of a type of data or a document.</li>
                            <li>It tells all the properties that the model has.</li>
                            <li>For example, User Schema would have properties like, name(string), age(number), bio(string) and Blog schema would have props like title(string), snippet(string), body(string) etcetera.</li>
                            <li>Next thing is to make a model which allows the developers to communicate with the schemas.</li>
                            <li>Mongoose can be installed in the app using NPM.</li>
                            <li>Connecting app to the database through Mongoose involves following lines code.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        // Adding Mongoose
        const mongoose = require("mongoose");

        //connect to MongoDB
        const dbUrl = "mongodb+srv://user1:test1234@nodepracticeproject.lrmbi.mongodb.net/node-blogging?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

        mongoose.connect(dbUrl, {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true});//Async task so then can be appended.
        .then((result) => console.log("Connected to DB"))
        .catch((err) => console.log(err));
    </code>
</pre>
                            <li>The connect method usually shows deprecation warning as its deprecated so an object argument is also associated to avoid that.</li>
                            <li>The request listening should not start until a connection is established so the listening method can be invoked in the then part of the connection phase as shown below.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        mongoose.connect(dbUrl, {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true});//Async task so then can be appended.
        .then((result) => app.listen(3000)
        .catch((err) => console.log(err));
    </code>
</pre>                          
                            <li>Next thing to do is to create a model for the schema.</li>
                            <li>It can be created in a separate folder.</li>
                            <li>It will also run on Mongoose, inlcuding the schema as shown.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        const mongoose = require("mongoose");
        const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

        const blogSchema = new Schema({
            title: {
                type: String,
                required: true 
            },
            snippet: {
                type: String,
                required: true
            },
            body: {
                type: String,
                required: true
            }
        }, {
            timestamps: true
        });
    </code>
</pre>                      
                            <li>The timestamps property in the  options object to the schema gives a timestamp to all the events happneing on the document through this model.</li>
                            <li>This schema defines the structure of the doucment.</li>          
                            <li>Model lets us interact with it surrounding the schema.</li>
                            <li>Just below the schema, a model can be created with a name starting from a Capital letter.</li>
                        </li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        const Blog = mongoose.model("Blog", blogSchema);
        module.exports = Blog;
    </code>
</pre>                      
                        <li>This finishes up the setting up of the blog schema.</li>
                        <li>
                            Getting and saving data
                            <ul>
                                <li>First create a new instance of the Blog.</li>
                                <li>To do that, include blog.js in the main code wth the help of require.</li>
                                <li>Handle it in a particular request and send data as per the schema as per the code below.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        app.get("/add-blog", (req, res) => {
            const blog = new Blog({
                title: My new blog,
                snippet: "About this new blog",
                body: "I hope I remember each and every step in the making as its a complicated long process."
            })
            
            blog.save().then((result) => res.send(result)).catch((err) => console.log(err));
        });
    </code>
</pre>
                            <li>blog.save() saves the document on the database and Mongoose returns an object after saving the blog and sends it back to the browser which is then visible on the page.</li>
                            <li>Now to get all the documents from the database another get handler can be formed as shown.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        app.get("/all-blogs", (req, res) => {
            Blog.find().then((result) => {
                res.send(result);
            }).catch((err) => console.log(err));
        });
    </code>
</pre>
                            <li>The difference here is that, save() is used on an instance of the blog and find works on the blog itself.</li>
                            <li>Find() returns all the documents available, however, we can fetch documents as per the id too as shown below.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        app.get("/single-blog", (req, res) => {
            Blog.findById("610bdc7259df441bc4397fd7").then((result) => {
                res.send(result);

        });
    </code>
</pre>
                            <li>The id is an object back at MongoDB but mongoose handles all the conversion between object and string.</li>                         
                            <li>Next step is to learn how to delete documents and how to ouptut them on views and not as responses to browser requests.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Outputting Docs to Views
                        <ul>
                            <li>The sandbox routes that were created are not the way to go. Instead the existing blog routes need their integration.</li>
                            <li>A new blog route is created which will get all the blog documents from the database.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        app.get("/", (req, res) => {
            res.redirect('/blogs');

    </code>
</pre>           
                            <li>To send the data from database to the view, Blog.find() returns all the documents available as array of objects.</li>                 
                            <li>The view should expect an object with the properties as per the schema of the blog database.</li>
                            <li>Everything that needs to be rendered on the view should be in the then part of the above code as it will run when the promise is resolved.</li>
                            <li>So first of all, the view is rendered, it is given a title and the next thing should be the data received from the blog.</li>
                            <li>By making an object with the name that the view expects and assigning the result to it does the job as shown.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        app.get("/blogs", (req, res) => {
            Blog.find().sort({createdAt: -1})

</pre>     
                            <li>Another thing that can be done is adding another method that would sort the blogs in some order.</li>                                  
                            <li>Sort( {createdAt: -1}) will sort them in the descneding order of their creation timestamps put on Mongoose.</li>
