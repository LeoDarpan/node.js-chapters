                What is Node.js?
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Node.js is a compiler that let's JS run outside of the browser
                </li>
                <li>
                    Written in C++, it runs on V8 engine, which is responsible for handling JS inside the browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It can <ul>
                        <li>do read/write operations on local files,</li>
                        <li>connect to a database,</li>
                        <li>and also act as a server itself.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Node server runs JS on the backend and serves requests made by the browsers using that JS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Benefits of learning node over other server side languages: <ul>
                        <li>No extra language needed as Node compiles JS itself</li>
                        <li>it can share code on both the ends (front and end)</li>
                        <li>Huge community support</li>
                        <li>Large number of third party packages and tools to help</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>After installation command prompt terminal can be used as terminal to run node.js</li>
                <li>
                    All the JS instructions can be run in terminal after writing the command node and pressing enter
                </li>
                <li>
                    To change the directory in terminall type .. to navigate to the parent directory one by one till the super parent directory or drive
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use cd to change directory and write the path to the directory where the files are present.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use mkdir to create a new directory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Type Code . , to open VS Code from the directory of work using the terminal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Just for knowledge
                    <ul>
                        <li>. - Means current directory</li>
                        <li>.. - Means parent directory</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Script files can also be run from the terminal in the VS Code itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Just direct the terminal to the directory where the file rests and write the command: node filename(no need to write extension)
                </li>
            </ul>
