                Middleware
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Middleware is that code that runs on the server between getting a request and sending a response.</li>
                <li>Any type of function that runs between these two operations is a middleware.</li>
                <li>For example - app.use() or app.get().</li>
                <li>The order of middleware matters a lot, as after reaching the state of respoding to the browser, it never carries on to the following middleware.</li>
                <li>
                    Examples of middleware programs are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logger middleware to log details of requests</li>
                        <li>Authentication check middleware for protected routes</li>
                        <li>Middleware to parse json data for messages.</li>
                        <li>To return 404 pages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Custom middleware can be made to do specific tasks as shown below:</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        app.use((req, res) => {
            console.log("New request made:");
            console.log("Host: ", req.hostname);
            console.log("Path: ", req.path);
            console.log("Method: ", req.method);
        });
    </code>
</pre>           
                <li>
                    Concept of Next:
                    <ul> 
                        <li>However, this middleware has a problem as after going through it, Node doesn't go further to run other following middlewares on requests and the browser keeps waiting for the response.</li>
                        <li>To resolve this issue, a method called "next()" exists.</li>
                        <li>Next is passed as a third parameter in the callback function taking req and res as parameters and it has to be invoked at the end of the middleware.</li>
                        <li>This tells Node that the current middleware has finished and now it should move on to the next middlewares.</li>
                        <li>The code snippet says it all below:</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        app.use((req, res, next) => {
            console.log("New request made:");
            console.log("Host: ", req.hostname);
            console.log("Path: ", req.path);
            console.log("Method: ", req.method);
            next();
        });
    </code>
</pre>                
                <li>
                    Third-party Middleware:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Good thing about Node and Express is that there are tons of third party middleware funcitons already available to use.</li>
                        <li>For example to log things, run cookies, validations, sessions etcetera and middleware for security</li>
                        <li>Therefore, there is no need to write to the middleware from the scratch, if its already made, just install it using NPM.</li>
                        <li>In the code below, a third party middleware called Morgan can be seen in action.</li>
<pre class="language-js">
    <code class="line-numbers">
        // Adding Morgan
        const morgan = require("morgan");
        
        //Listen to requests on Port: 3000, Localhost
        app.listen(3000);

        //Using Morgan
        app.use(morgan('dev'));

        console.log("Another variant of morgan: ");

        app.use(morgan("tiny"));
    </code>
</pre>  
                    </ul>                
                </li>
                <li>There are plenty of third-party middleware, most important of them all is the one needed to send static files to the app.</li>                        
            </ul>
